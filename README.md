# Anycubic Mega-S Marlin 1.1.9 by Stot

This is a custom version of the [Marlin Firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) for the Anycubic Mega-S, based on [ davidramiro's repo](https://github.com/davidramiro/Marlin-Ai3M).

## Why use this?

Other than the great updates added by Davids repo this fork has support for the Stot Switching Extruder, a single stepper extruder capable of automatically switching between 4 filaments.

To support this a second menu has been added for 'Filament' to select active filaments and load/unload them.

I also made the existing 'Special' menu easier to read on the AnyCubic TFT

## How to flash this?

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- Clone or download this repo
- Browse into the Marlin folder and run `Marlin.ino`
- In the IDE, under `Tools -> Board` select `Genuino Mega 2560` and `ATmega2560`
- Open Marlin.ino in the Marlin directory of this repo
- [Customize if needed](https://github.com/davidramiro/Marlin-AI3M/wiki/Customization-&-Compiling) (e.g. motor directions and type at line `559` to `566` and line `857` to `865` in `Configuration.h`)
- Under `Sketch`, select `Export compiled binary`
- Look for the .hex file in the Marlin directory (only use the `Marlin.ino.hex`, not the `Marlin.ino.with_bootloader.hex`!)

### After obtaining the hex file:

- Flash the hex with Cura, OctoPrint or similar

### Testing your bed leveling

- No need to download or create a bed leveling test, simply send those commands to your printer:
```
G28
G26 C H200 P5 R25 Q4.2 Z4
```
- To adjust your filament's needed temperature, change the number of the `H` parameter
- Default bed temperature is 60°C, if you need another temperature, add e.g. `B80`
- `Q` parameter sets retraction length in mm, `Z` sets unretraction.
- If your leveling is good, you will have a complete pattern of your mesh on your bed that you can peel off in one piece
- Don't worry if the test looks a bit messy, the important thing is just that the line width is the same all over the mesh
- Optional: Hang it up on a wall to display it as a trophy of how great your leveling skills are.


## M600 Filament Change

![M600 Demo][m600 demo]

[m600 demo]: https://kore.cc/i3mega/img/m600demo.jpg "M600 demo"

**BETA: This now also works without USB printing, via SD & display.**

#### Configuration (only needed once):
- Send `M603 L0 U0` to use manual loading & unloading.
- Send `M603 L538 U555` to use automatic loading & unloading
  - The `L` and `U` paramters define the load and unload length in mm. The values above work well on a stock setup, if you modded your extruder, bowden tube or hotend, you might need to adjust those.
- Save with `M500`

#### Filament change process (manual loading):
- For printing via SD:
  - Place `M600` in your GCode at the desired layer
- For printing via USB:
  - Place `M600` in your GCode at the desired layer or send it via terminal
  - Alternatively: Use `FilamentChange Pause` in the Special Menu
- The nozzle will park and your printer will beep
  - For safety reasons, the printer will turn off the hotend after 10 minutes. If you see the temperature being under the target:
    - SD printing: Click `CONTINUE` **(only once!)** on the screen and wait for the hotend to heat up again.
    - USB printing: Send `M108` and wait for the hotend to heat up again.
- Remove the filament from the bowden tube
- Insert the new filament right up to the nozzle, just until a bit of plastic oozes out
- Remove the excess filament from the nozzle with tweezers
- For printing via SD:
  - Click `CONTINUE` on the screen
- For printing via USB:
  - Send `M108` via your USB host or use `FilamentChange Resume` in the Special Menu
  - Note for OctoPrint users: After sending `M108`, enable the advanced options at the bottom of the terminal and press `Fake Acknowledgement`

#### Filament change process (automatic loading):
- For printing via SD:
  - Place `M600` in your GCode at the desired layer
- For printing via USB:
  - Place `M600` in your GCode at the desired layer or send it via terminal
  - Alternatively: Use `FilamentChange Pause` in the Special Menu
- The nozzle will park
- The printer will remove the filament right up to the extruder and beep when finished
  - For safety reasons, the printer will turn off the hotend after 10 minutes. If you see the temperature being under the target:
    - SD printing: Click `CONTINUE` **(only once!)** on the screen and wait for the hotend to heat up again.
    - USB printing: Send `M108` and wait for the hotend to heat up again.
- Insert the new filament just up to the end of the bowden fitting, as shown here:

![Load Filament][m600 load]

[m600 load]: https://kore.cc/i3mega/img/load.jpg "M600 Load"

- For printing via SD:
  - Click `CONTINUE` on the screen
- For printing via USB:
  - Send `M108` via your USB host or use `FilamentChange Resume` in the Special Menu
  - Note for OctoPrint users: After sending `M108`, enable the advanced options at the bottom of the terminal and press `Fake Acknowledgement`
- The printer will now pull in the new filament, watch out since it might ooze quite a bit from the nozzle
- Remove the excess filament from the nozzle with tweezers


## Updating

### Back up & restore your settings

Some updates require the storage to be cleared (`M502`), if mentioned in the update log. In those cases, before updating, send `M503` and make a backup of all the lines starting with:

```
M92
G29
M301
M304
```

After flashing the new version, issue a `M502` and `M500`. After that, enter every line you saved before and finish by saving with `M500`.

## Something went wrong?
No worries. You can easily go back to the default firmware and restore the default settings.
- Flash the hex file from the [manufacturer's website](http://www.anycubic3d.com/support/show/594016.html)
- After flashing, send `M502` and `M500`. Now your machine is exactly as it came out of the box.

## Changes by [derhopp](https://github.com/derhopp/):

- 12V capability on FAN0 (parts cooling fan) enabled
- Buzzer disabled (e.g. startup beep)
- Subdirectory support: Press the round arrow after selecting a directory
- Special menu in the SD file menu: Press the round arrow after selecting `Special menu`



## About Marlin

<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

Marlin is an optimized firmware for [RepRap 3D printers](http://reprap.org/) based on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform. First created in 2011 for RepRap and Ultimaker printers, today Marlin drives a majority of the world's most popular 3D printers. Marlin delivers outstanding print quality with unprecedented control over the process.
